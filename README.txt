Hello there!

I have made various Python files in which each one tests out new things. For example: input.py is a simple input detector. It detects the text you have wrote.

I would spend more time on this after I factory reset tomorrow. My PC is lagging badly and it needs to be reset.

You can find the repo on GitHub Here:
